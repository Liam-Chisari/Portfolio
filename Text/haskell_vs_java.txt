Core Concepts
Feature	Haskell	Java
Paradigm	Functional (declarative)	Object-Oriented (imperative)
Immutability	Values are immutable by default, promoting safety and predictability.	Variables can be mutable or immutable, requiring explicit declaration (final) for immutability.
Functions	First-class citizens, treated as data, easily composed and passed around.	Methods are associated with objects and classes.
Data Structures	Lists are fundamental, often used for data manipulation and processing.	Arrays, Lists, Sets, Maps are common for data storage and manipulation.
Error Handling	Algebraic data types like Maybe and Either for representing possible errors or values.	Exceptions are thrown and caught to handle errors.
I/O	Uses IO monad to encapsulate side effects like file I/O and user input.	Stream-based I/O (BufferedReader, BufferedWriter) or higher-level file APIs (Files, Paths) are used.

Code Comparison

Let's look at snippets for specific tasks:

1. File Reading

handle <- openFile filename ReadMode
contents <- hGetContents handle

BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename));
String contents = reader.lines().collect(Collectors.joining("\n"));
reader.close();

    Haskell:  Uses a file handle and hGetContents for lazy I/O.
    Java: Opens a BufferedReader and reads lines using streams, collecting them into a single string.

2. Word Splitting

allWords = words contents

String[] allWords = contents.split("\\s+");

    Haskell: words function directly splits the string into a list of words based on whitespace.
    Java: split method splits the string using a regular expression for whitespace.

3. Finding Longest Word and Longest 10

longestWord = maximumBy (compare `on` length) allWords
longest10 = take 10 (sortBy (flip compare `on` length) allWords)

String longestWord = Arrays.stream(allWords)
                            .max(Comparator.comparingInt(String::length))
                            .orElse("");

List<String> longest10 = Arrays.stream(allWords)
                                .sorted(Comparator.comparingInt(String::length).reversed())
                                .limit(10)
                                .collect(Collectors.toList());

    Haskell:  Leverages higher-order functions maximumBy and sortBy with lambda expressions.
    Java: Uses streams with max, sorted, limit, and collect for a similar effect.

4. CSV Writing

writeFile "longest.csv" (unlines longest10)

FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("longest.csv");
for (String word : longest10) {
    writer.write(word + "\n");
}
writer.close();

    Haskell: Concisely writes lines using unlines.
    Java: Requires manual iteration to write each word with a newline.

Additional Considerations

    Typing: Haskell's strong static typing can catch errors at compile time, while Java's type system is less strict.
    Error Handling: Haskell uses Maybe for optional values and Either to represent potential errors. Java uses exceptions.
